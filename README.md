# jmatrix

In the process of being built - use at your own risk.

## Running
Running `./run.sh` will compile the code and run the top-level driver file I am
using for testing.

## Features
* Initialize a matrix from
  * two-dimensional arrays
  * one-dimensional arrays**
  * strings**
  * files**
* Unary matrix operations
  * abs**
  * negative**
  * transpose**
* Binary matrix operations
  * addition**
  * subtraction**
  * scalar multiplication**
  * matrix multiplication**
* Other
  * trace**
  * determinant**
  * inverse**
* Potentially also
  * fill with random values
  * shuffle
  * resize
  * sparse matrices with sparsify/densify functions
  * flexible numerical types
  * smart slicing

## Learning log
* All about Java exceptions (checked and unchecked)
* Wrote my first custom exception (then deleted it because I found better pre-existing ones)
* Bundling Java classes++ into a package / accessing package members
* MATH!
